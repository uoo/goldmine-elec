Electronic Goldmine part numbers

Electronic Goldmine (http://goldmine-elec-products.com) doesn't label their
goods with what they are, but the Goldmine catalog number.  However,
when things go out of stock, the description disappears.  Therefore, I
have been keeping a list of part numbers I've purchased, and what they are.
I hand type these from the packing lists.  Contributions are welcome.
